Write an script that do the following :
1. define x in range 0,4*pi with step 0.01
2. define a function to calculate 
   y = exp(-x)*1*cos(10*x-0.5)
3. save the x and y in a txt file with 6 decimal 
   place and in two coloumn 
4. plot the results
5. time the whole process
6. Do the same steps but with out for loops
   note: use numpy arrays and functions 
   for vectorization
7. Compare the timing of using loop and vectorization 
   and calculate the speedup
